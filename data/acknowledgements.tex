First and foremost, I am deeply grateful to Prof. Jidong Zhai for his support and guidance throughout the entirety of this thesis project. From the proposal stage to the research process, final presentation, and revisions, Prof. Zhai's expertise and mentorship have been invaluable. Additionally, I am grateful for his feedback on my status reports and for his assistance in navigating the challenges posed by the border closure and my arrival at Tsinghua University, including helping me schedule meetings at times that worked in my timezone, and putting me in contact with fellow students that helped me understand and fill all required forms in time, despite knowing very little Chinese. I would also like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Prof. Zhihao Jia from Carnegie Mellon University for co-advising the \Project project. His regular meetings, invaluable advice, and provision of necessary resources, including computing facilities for developing and testing the \Project prototype, have been immensely beneficial to my research progress. I am indebted to my Tsinghua classmates for their friendship and camaraderie, making me feel at home away from home. From online orientation events to working together on projects, meeting up in different cities like Paris and Milan, and finally being reunited on the beautiful Tsinghua campus in Beijing, these cherished memories have enriched my MS program experience. I am also grateful to my Tsinghua lab mates for their mentorship and assistance with my project, as well as helping me navigate campus life and having a unforgettable experience here at Tsinghua University. My heartfelt thanks also go to my CMU lab mates Xinhao Cheng, Rae Wong, Zeyu Wang, Zhihao Zhang, Daiyaan Arfeen, Hongyi Jin, Bohan Hou, and to graduate students Reyna Abhyankar and Colin Unger, who have make significant contributions to the project. Lastly, I am deeply grateful to my family, my girlfriend, and my long-time friends for their unwavering love, support, and encouragement.
